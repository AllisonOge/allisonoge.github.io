**Short Bio**

Hey! My name is Allison Ogechukwu and I love Machine learning,  Data Science and Software Engineering. I want to bring a new perspective (mine) to the already vast archive of information. 

**Education**

B.Eng, *University of Benin, Benin City, Nigeria* December 2019

**Projects**

Here are my honourable mentions:

- Explored the world of neural networks using tensorflow and keras in the project, [**diabetes-classification-project**](https://github.com/AllisonOge/diabetes-classification-project). I developed a model to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
- A look at the web development world with one of python backend libraries, fastAPI in the project, [**fastAPI-microservice**](https://github.com/AllisonOge/fastAPI_microservice). It is still a work in progress but primarily, I have gained some understanding of JWTs and ENV variables amongst others.
- My oldest child in the tree of projects is the [**scs_predictive_analysis**](https://github.com/AllisonOge/scs_predictive_analysis). In this project, I took a tour through wireless networks and eventually stumbled upon the world of cognitive radio networks. Knowledge in this project range from digital signal processing with MATLAB and GNU Radio, wireless communication principles (modulation techniques like OFDM, GMSK, PSK, FM etc.), antenna theory (a bit) and Machine learning (we can't make a good prediction without ML). The tools I am exploring presently is the [FIT/CorteXlab](http://www.cortexlab.fr/) as it allows me to access world class SDRs located in France for free with my research. Anyone interested can always shot me a mail @ [ogechukwukanu@gmail.com](mailto:ogechukwukanu@gmail.com).

**Hobbies**

I love singing, reading and learning.
