## **Short Bio**
Hi! I am Ogechukwu Allison Kanu preferably going by Allison Ogechukwu. I find unreveiling mystery in ML/AI fascinating...what makes an AI model? what technologies have we discovered to build generalizable and capable models? what are their strengths and weaknesses? how can we overcome these weaknesses? are questions I love exploring and attempting to answer.

## **Education**

- MSC, *Univeristy of Calgary, Calgary, Canada* December 2025

- B.Eng, *University of Benin, Benin City, Nigeria* December 2019

## **Projects**
Here are my honourable mentions:

> 
- ## Machine Learning and Wireless Networks

  - **[RadioSSL](https://github.com/AllisonOge/RadioSSL){:target="_blank"}**- builds generalizable model for both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks.
  
  <!-- We develop and train models on large unlabelled datasets across multiple tasks to learn latent invariant representations used across various wireless communication tasks at the front-end or PHY layer. Ultimately, I ask and answer the question 'Can a single model meet or outperform fully supervised models trained in a task-specific manner across multiple tasks both in-distribution and out-of-distribution with frozen embeddings?' and many other questions. -->

  - **[qIQ2Seq_forecast](https://github.com/Qoherent-WAVESLAB/qIQ2Seq_forecast){:target="_blank"}** takes history of IQ samples and predicts a 2ms window in the future.

  - **[qRadioMoCo](https://github.com/Qoherent-WAVESLAB/qRadioMoCo){:target="_blank"}** attempts to learns two in distribution tasks with self-supervised learning using MoCo framework.

  - **[qSeptroDetect](https://github.com/Qoherent-WAVESLAB/qSpectroDetect){:target="_blank"}** is a signal localization and classification model on both narrow and wideband spectrum given IQ samples.


- ## Statistical Optimization problems

  - **[spectral_estnoise_ms](https://github.com/AllisonOge/spectral_estnoise_ms){:target="_blank"}**-In this project, I took a ride down Statistical Optimization problems. I implemented and tested a noise estimation algorithm in developed for voice activity detectors (VAD) on radio frequency signals as a proposed method of dynamic thresholding required by ITU for spectral occupancy measurements. At the end of the research, we published a paper titled *[Spectral Noise Estimation: A Python 3 Implementation of the Minimum Statistics Estimation](https://doi.org/10.36263/nijest.2022.01.0300){:target="_blank"}*.

- ## Software Engineering

  - **[alxbot-project](https://github.com/AllisonOge/alxbot-project){:target="_blank"}** - Built a google chrome extension to support learning for an ALX user. It integrates with LLMs (like ChatGPT) to deliver accurate, context-aware responses using RAG pipeline with LangChain. Additional features include note-taking, MCQ quizzes for knowledge testing, and conversation history tracking.

  - **[mvp-wallet-service-app](https://github.com/AllisonOge/mvp-wallet-service-app){:target="_blank"}**-In this project, I explored REST APIs and developed an MVP for a wallet service. User can autheticate using JWTs and open accounts to perform common transactions like deposit, withdraw and transfer funds.

## **Hobbies**
I love singing, reading, learning, sports and music.
